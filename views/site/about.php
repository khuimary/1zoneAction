        <h2>Introduce Yourselves</h2>
To humanize your company, include staff 
photos and bios on your About Us page. 
These staff bios are a great chance to do 
double duty of reflecting the values of your 
company while showing the personality of 
your individual employees. For small 
companies, consider designing a grid to 
showcase each employee separately with a 
photo, quippy bio, and their title. You could 
even take it one step further and show off 
your personality like Wistia (hover over the 
photos to see what we’re talking about.) 
For larger organizations, group team photos 
are an opportunity to showcase your 
wonderful employees without overwhelming 
the About Us page with clutter. And for 
exceptionally large companies, a singular 
group photo does wonders to display the 
community of your organization.
<h3>Your Real Story</h3>
Now that you’ve told your visitor why your business is essential and 
showed them your glorious face, it is time to put the icing on the top 
of your introduction by telling them your story. How did you start your 
company? What aspect of society shouted to you for help? And why 
did you choose to answer the call? The way to connect to your visitor, 
and make them a lasting friend, is with a good story. Your story. Even 
if the origin of your corporation doesn’t sound to you like a bestseller, 
when told in an engaging and recognizable fashion it will entice your 
potential future customers to stick around and learn more.
<h4>Call To Action</h4>
Now that you’ve got your website visitors enticed with your brilliantly 
written company story, what do you want them to do? Instead of 
leaving this choice up to them, direct them to the next step with a 
centrally placed and engaging call to action (CTA). This CTA will look 
differently depending on what your ideal next move is for your visitor. 
Maybe you want them to “Read More” by directing them over to 
your company blog. Or maybe you’d prefer they sign up to 
talk to a sales representative or book a product demo. 
As to not overwhelm and push away your visitor, your 
About Us page should include one clear CTA that 
moves your new relationship to the next level
